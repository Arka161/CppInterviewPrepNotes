# Welcome to the C++ Interview Preparation Repository
In this repository, I am going to add notes on C++, its internals, and try to condense it in a form quickly graspable for brushing up something for an interview. I am working on it for my own job hunting, but I thought making it open-source might help others led by a Google search for anything I might add.

## I have just started work on 09/11/21, and I would expect decent progress on this repo within a month :) 

# Disclaimer: 

**I do not claim to be a C++ expert**, and I am not suggesting that this repo is a comprehensive guide for any of the topics. They are intended to serve as a refresher, and I will of course assume the reader has a certain degree of familiairty with the fundamenals of C++. Some of my code could be too C++11 inspired and might not be the most up to date (I started programming a lot in C++ when C++11 was just released), so please create an issue/PR and I'll look into it. 

# Motivation: 

I have written production code in C++ in the past during some of my jobs, but I thought it's a good thing to write this repo, as more often than not, you wouldn't be using some of the core C++ features in production, and especially so if the codebase you're maintaining is a Legacy feature. To give context, in most cases, you can get by writing production code just fine, even if if you do not know the internal mechanics of a trivial operator like the `const_cast`, or the `N` number of cyclic resourcing scenarios with `shared_ptr`.
