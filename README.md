# Welcome to the C++ Interview Preparation Repository
In this repository, I am going to add notes on C++, its internals, and try to condense it in a form quickly graspable for brushing up something for an interview. I am working on it for my own job hunting, but I thought making it open-source might help others led by a Google search for anything I might add.

# Disclaimer: 

I do not claim to be a C++ expert, and I am not suggesting that this repo is a comprehensive guide for many of the topics. They are intended to serve as a refresher, and I will of course assume the reader has a certain degree of familiairty with C++ basics.
