# Welcome to the C++ Interview Preparation Repository
In this repository, I am going to add notes on C++, its internals, and try to condense it in a form quickly graspable for brushing up something for an interview. I am working on it for my own job hunting, but I thought making it open-source might help others led by a Google search for anything I might add.

# Disclaimer: 

**I do not claim to be a C++ expert**, and I am not suggesting that this repo is a comprehensive guide for any of the topics. They are intended to serve as a refresher, and I will of course assume the reader has a certain degree of familiairty with C++ basics. 

# Motivation: 

I have written production code in C++ in the past during some of my jobs, but I thought it's a good thing to write this repo, as more often than not, you wouldn't be using some of the core C++ features in production, and especially so if the codebase you're maintaining is a Legacy feature. To give context, you can get by writing production code just fine if you do not know the internal mechanics of a trivial operator like the `const_cast`.
